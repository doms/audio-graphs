## Development Setup

1. `git clone https://github.com/doms/asdr.git && cd asdr`
2. `npm install`
3. Create an `.env` file in the root directory, then [add an app on Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/) and paste the Client ID and Secret into the `.env` file
3. `npm start`
4. `http://localhost:4000/`

That was easy.
